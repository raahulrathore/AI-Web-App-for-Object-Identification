# AI-Web-App-for-Object-Identification-using-Keras-and-Django

This is a Web Application developed using Django and Keras which can identify Images and Classify them.
It uses ResNet-50 Image Classifier which is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. 
You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database.
The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. 
As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. The network has an image input size of 224-by-224.
[Imagenet-Classes](https://github.com/raahulrathore/AI-Web-App-for-Object-Identification-using-Keras-and-Django/blob/main/imagenetClasses/imagenet-classes.txt) is 
having the list of 1000 different classes under which this Application classifies them.
